This folder contains several files which can be run invidually, but ideally the rivercrossingWaitInput is the program to run. In current version the system awaits input from the client to the server to start the simulation, as soon as the server recieves an ready signal it continues. This means that any other ready signals that is sent after this will recieve an error message. This way we prevent more than one client to send ready signal to the main program. A other aproach would have the server putting the request in a queve / array, and then sort them, but that proved problematic and we chose to have a ready signal that can only be recieved once each simulation.
